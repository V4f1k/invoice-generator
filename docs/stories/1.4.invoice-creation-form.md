# Story 1.4: Basic Invoice Creation Form

## Status
- Done

## Story
**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** a simple form to create a new invoice with line items,
**so that** I can capture all the necessary details for billing a client.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The UI provides a clear "Create New Invoice" action.
2. The form includes fields for manually entering client information.
3. The form includes fields for invoice metadata (e.g., issue date, due date).
4. The user can dynamically add, edit, and remove line items (description, quantity, unit price).
5. The form automatically calculates the total for each line and the grand total for the invoice.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Create Invoice and Line Item Database Tables (AC: #2, #3, #4)**
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Define the `invoices` table schema, including fields for `supplier_id`, client details (e.g., `client_name`, `client_address`), `issue_date`, `due_date`, and calculated totals.
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Define the `invoice_items` table schema with a foreign key to the `invoices` table, including fields for `description`, `quantity`, and `unit_price`.
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Implement and apply the database migrations for the new tables.
- [x] **Task 2: Create Frontend Invoice Editor Component (AC: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5)**
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Add a prominent "Create New Invoice" button to the main application layout or dashboard.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Build the invoice form, preferably within a modal dialog as specified in the front-end spec.
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Construct the form using ShadCN components, including inputs for manual client info and date pickers for issue/due dates.
  - [x] Subtask 2.4: Implement the dynamic line items section. Use `React Hook Form`'s `useFieldArray` for managing the state of this section.
  - [x] Subtask 2.5: Implement client-side logic to automatically calculate line totals and the grand total as the user types. This should be done by watching form fields.

## Dev Notes
- This story focuses on creating the database tables and the client-side form experience. The backend endpoint to save the invoice data will be handled in Story 1.5.
- The front-end spec recommends using `React Hook Form` for form state management and `Zod` for validation. This approach should be used here.
- The calculation logic should be robust to handle various numeric inputs correctly.

### Testing
- Database migration files should be tested to ensure they apply and revert correctly.
- Extensive component tests are required for the invoice editor form. Pay special attention to the dynamic line items (`useFieldArray`) and the automatic calculation logic.
- Form validation should be tested to ensure it provides correct feedback to the user.
