# Story 1.6: Compliant PDF Generation

## Status
- Ready for Review 

## Story
**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** to download a PDF of a saved invoice,
**so that** I have a professional, standards-compliant document to send to my client.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The invoice view page has a "Download PDF" button.
2. The generated PDF is clean, professional, and uses the first available template.
3. The PDF correctly displays all supplier, client, and invoice information.
4. A correctly formatted Czech SPAYD QR code is included on the PDF, which meets the following conditions:
   - The Variable Symbol (`X-VS`) used for the QR code is the invoice number (in `YYMMDDXXXX` format).
   - The Message for Recipient (`MSG`) in the QR code data contains the client's name.
   - It uses the Bank Account Number (IBAN) from the supplier's settings.
5. The supplier's Bank Account Number and the invoice's Variable Symbol are displayed on the PDF under the supplier's details, in a style similar to the issue/due date block.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Implement PDF Generation Service (AC: #2, #3)**
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Install Puppeteer for headless Chrome PDF generation on the backend.
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Create a dedicated, un-routed React component that serves as the printable PDF template.
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Implement a backend service that takes invoice data, renders the React template to an HTML string, and uses Puppeteer to convert the HTML to a PDF buffer.
- [x] **Task 2: Implement SPAYD QR Code Generation (AC: #4)**
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Research and install a reliable library for generating Czech SPAYD (Short Payment Descriptor) strings and QR codes.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Modify the QR code generation utility to fetch and use the supplier's bank account (from Story 1.3), the invoice number as the variable symbol (from Story 1.5), and the client's name as the message.
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Integrate the generated QR code image into the PDF template component.
- [x] **Task 3: Update PDF Template Layout (AC: #5)**
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: In `InvoicePDFTemplate.tsx`, add a new section under the supplier's details to display the Bank Account and Variable Symbol.
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Style this new section to mimic the two-column layout of the issue/due date block.
- [x] **Task 4: Implement PDF Download API Endpoint (AC: #1)**
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Create a `GET /api/v1/invoices/{id}/pdf` endpoint, protected by authentication.
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: The endpoint should call the PDF generation service for the requested invoice, ensuring the user owns the invoice.
  - [x] Subtask 4.3: The endpoint must return the generated PDF with the correct `Content-Type` (`application/pdf`) and `Content-Disposition` headers to trigger a browser download.
- [x] **Task 5: Add Download Button to Frontend (AC: #1)**
  - [x] Subtask 5.1: Add a "Download PDF" button to the invoice view page (`/invoices/[id]`).
  - [x] Subtask 5.2: The button should link directly to the `GET /api/v1/invoices/{id}/pdf` endpoint, opening the link in a new tab or triggering a direct download.

## Dev Notes
- **Dependencies**: This story's implementation depends on data from other stories: Bank Account (1.3), Invoice Number format (1.5), and Variable Symbol logic (1.10).
- **Source of Bank Account**: The SPAYD QR code generation must use the Bank Account Number (IBAN) from the supplier's settings (defined in Story 1.3).
- The architecture specifies using **Puppeteer** for PDF generation. This allows us to use React and CSS to create pixel-perfect, professional templates.
- The **SPAYD QR code** is a critical feature. The data format must be 100% compliant with the Czech banking standard. Double-check the format requirements (IBAN, amount, currency, etc.).
- The PDF template component should be developed as a separate, isolated React component to make styling and maintenance easier.

### Testing
- Unit tests are critical for the SPAYD QR code generation utility to ensure the data string is always correctly formatted.
- An integration test for the `GET /invoices/{id}/pdf` endpoint should verify the response headers and check that the response body is a valid PDF.
- **Manual testing is required** for this story. The downloaded PDF must be visually inspected to confirm the layout is correct and professional. The QR code must be tested with a real banking app to ensure it is scannable and contains the correct payment information.
