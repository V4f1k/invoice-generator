# Story 5.1: Turbopack Re-implementation with Dynamic Route Testing

## Status
- Draft

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** to re-implement Turbopack bundler with comprehensive testing for dynamic routes and proper fallback mechanisms,
**so that** we can benefit from Turbopack's faster build times while ensuring all dynamic routes (especially `/invoices/[id]`) work reliably without hanging or timeout issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Turbopack is re-enabled for both development and build processes with comprehensive testing in place.
2. All dynamic routes, specifically `/invoices/[id]`, load successfully without hanging or timeout issues when using Turbopack.
3. A comprehensive test suite validates all dynamic routes function correctly with Turbopack enabled.
4. Fallback mechanisms are implemented to automatically disable Turbopack if dynamic route issues are detected.
5. Performance benchmarks are established comparing Webpack vs Turbopack build times and bundle sizes.
6. Development environment includes automated testing that validates dynamic routes before starting the development server.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Create Dynamic Route Testing Infrastructure (AC: #3, #6)**

  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Re-enable Turbopack in `package.json` dev and build scripts
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Create fallback mechanism that switches to Webpack if dynamic route tests fail
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Implement environment variable toggle for Turbopack/Webpack switching
  - [ ] Subtask 2.4: Create development script that validates routes before enabling Turbopack

- [ ] **Task 3: Comprehensive Dynamic Route Validation (AC: #2)**
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Test all invoice-related dynamic routes (`/invoices/[id]`, `/invoices/[id]/edit`, etc.)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Test with various ID formats (numeric, UUID, special characters)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Test with i18n locales and dynamic routes combination
  - [ ] Subtask 3.4: Validate SSR rendering of dynamic routes with Turbopack

- [ ] **Task 4: Performance Benchmarking and Monitoring (AC: #5)**
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Create performance benchmark suite comparing Webpack vs Turbopack
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Measure and document build time improvements
  - [ ] Subtask 4.3: Analyze bundle size differences between bundlers
  - [ ] Subtask 4.4: Implement continuous performance monitoring

- [ ] **Task 5: Documentation and Developer Experience (AC: #4)**
  - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Document known Turbopack limitations and workarounds
  - [ ] Subtask 5.2: Create troubleshooting guide for dynamic route issues
  - [ ] Subtask 5.3: Update development setup instructions with Turbopack details
  - [ ] Subtask 5.4: Create debugging tools for Turbopack-specific issues

## Dev Notes
### Critical Context from Previous Debugging Session
- **Root Cause**: Turbopack in Next.js 15.5.2 has known compatibility issues with dynamic routes, specifically causing complete hanging of `/invoices/[id]` pages with 15-second timeouts and 0 bytes received.
- **Confirmed Fix**: Removing `--turbopack` flag from dev script immediately resolved the hanging issue, with pages loading successfully in ~2 seconds.
- **i18n Impact**: The hanging occurred even after simplifying i18n configuration, confirming the issue was at the bundler level, not application level.

### Technical Requirements
- **Next.js Version**: 15.5.2 (current)
- **Turbopack Integration**: Must work with App Router and server-side rendering
- **Dynamic Routes**: Focus on `/invoices/[id]` pattern but test all dynamic routes
- **i18n Compatibility**: Must work with next-intl middleware and server-side locale detection
- **Fallback Strategy**: Automatic detection and graceful degradation to Webpack when issues occur

### Architecture Considerations
- **Build Configuration**: Both development and build processes should support Turbopack with fallback
- **Testing Strategy**: Pre-flight checks before enabling Turbopack in development
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous validation that Turbopack is providing benefits without regressions
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and automatic fallback when Turbopack issues are detected

### Testing
- **Dynamic Route Testing**: Comprehensive test suite covering all dynamic route patterns
- **Load Testing**: Performance validation under various load conditions
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Ensure Turbopack bundles work across all target browsers
- **Integration Testing**: Validate interaction between Turbopack, i18n, and SSR
- **Automated Health Checks**: Continuous validation of dynamic route functionality

### Known Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Turbopack may have unresolved issues with dynamic routes in Next.js 15.5.2
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing suite and automatic fallback to Webpack
- **Risk**: Build performance gains may not justify complexity
- **Mitigation**: Detailed performance benchmarking and clear ROI analysis
- **Risk**: Future Next.js updates may change Turbopack behavior
- **Mitigation**: Version-specific testing and upgrade validation procedures

### Pre-implementation QA Assessment
**Quality Gate Status**: DRAFT - Requires comprehensive implementation and testing before production readiness.

**Critical Success Factors**:
1. **Dynamic Route Stability**: Zero tolerance for hanging or timeout issues
2. **Performance Validation**: Measurable improvement in build times without functionality regression
3. **Fallback Reliability**: Automatic detection and graceful degradation when issues occur
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full coverage of all dynamic route patterns and edge cases

**Risk Mitigation Strategy**: 
- Staged rollout with extensive testing at each phase
- Automated health checks and fallback mechanisms
- Clear rollback procedures if issues are detected
- Performance benchmarking to validate benefits justify complexity
