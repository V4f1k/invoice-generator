# Story 1.3: Supplier Information Management

## Status
- Done

## Story
**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** to enter, save, and edit my company's (supplier) details,
**so that** my correct business information automatically appears on all my invoices.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A "Settings" page exists for logged-in users.
2. On this page, a user can save their company name, address, IČO, DIČ, and Bank Account Number (IBAN).
3. This information is correctly associated with their user account in the database.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Create Supplier Model and Database Table (AC: #3)**
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Define the `suppliers` table schema (id, user_id, name, address, ico, dic, timestamps).
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Add a `bank_account` text field to the `suppliers` table schema.
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Establish a unique one-to-one relationship with the `users` table via the `user_id` foreign key.
  - [x] Subtask 1.4: Implement and apply all database migrations.
- [x] **Task 2: Implement Supplier API Endpoints (AC: #2, #3)**
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create a `GET /api/v1/supplier` endpoint to retrieve the current user's supplier info.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Create a `PUT /api/v1/supplier` endpoint to create or update the supplier info (including the new `bank_account` field).
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Protect both endpoints with the authentication middleware created in Story 1.2.
- [x] **Task 3: Create Frontend Settings Page (AC: #1, #2)**
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Create a new route and page component for `/settings`.
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Ensure the `/settings` route is protected and only accessible to logged-in users.
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Add a new input field for "Bank Account Number (IBAN)" to the `/settings` form.
  - [x] Subtask 3.4: Build the settings form using ShadCN components for company name, address, IČO, and DIČ.
  - [x] Subtask 3.5: Implement logic to fetch existing data using the `GET` endpoint when the page loads.
  - [x] Subtask 3.6: Implement logic to save data using the `PUT` endpoint on form submission.

## Dev Notes
- The API endpoints must operate on the currently authenticated user. The `user_id` should be extracted from the validated JWT payload by the authentication middleware, not passed as a parameter from the client.
- The `PUT` endpoint should handle both creation (if no supplier info exists for the user) and update (if it does) in an idempotent manner.

### Testing
- Integration tests are required for the `GET` and `PUT` `/api/v1/supplier` endpoints. Ensure they fail correctly for unauthenticated users.
- Frontend tests for the Settings page should verify that the form loads existing data correctly and submits new data.
- An E2E test should cover the user journey: logging in, navigating to the settings page, filling out and saving the form, and verifying that the data persists on a page reload.
