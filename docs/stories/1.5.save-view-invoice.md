# Story 1.5: Save and View Invoice

## Status
- Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** to save my completed invoice and view it on a dedicated page,
**so that** my work is safely stored and I can review it before sending.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A "Save Invoice" action persists the invoice data to the database.
2. A unique invoice number in the format `YYMMDDXXXXX` (e.g., 25082900001) is automatically generated and saved upon creation. The `XXXXX` part should be a sequence that resets daily.
3. After saving, the user is redirected to a read-only view of the newly created invoice.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Implement Invoice Creation API Endpoint (AC: #1, #2)**
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create a `POST /api/v1/invoices` endpoint, protected by the authentication middleware.
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: The endpoint should accept the invoice form data, including nested line items, and validate it using Zod.
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Implement logic to generate a unique invoice number in the format `YYMMDDXXXXX` for the authenticated supplier. This must be handled atomically, with the sequence resetting each day.
  - [x] Subtask 1.4: Save the invoice and its line items to the database within a single database transaction.
  - [x] Subtask 1.5: Return the newly created invoice object, including its generated invoice number.
- [x] **Task 2: Implement Invoice Viewing API Endpoint (AC: #3)**
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create a `GET /api/v1/invoices/{id}` endpoint, protected by the authentication middleware.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Ensure the endpoint only returns invoices that belong to the authenticated user's supplier.
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: The endpoint should return the invoice along with its associated supplier and line item data.
- [x] **Task 3: Connect Frontend Form to API (AC: #1)**
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Add a "Save Invoice" button to the invoice editor form.
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: On form submission, send the validated form data to the `POST /api/v1/invoices` endpoint.
- [x] **Task 4: Create Frontend Invoice View Page (AC: #3)**
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Create a new dynamic route and page for `/invoices/[id]`.
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: On page load, fetch the invoice data using the `GET /api/v1/invoices/{id}` endpoint.
  - [x] Subtask 4.3: Display the invoice data in a clean, read-only format using ShadCN components.
  - [x] Subtask 4.4: After successfully saving a new invoice, redirect the user to the new view page.

## Dev Notes
- **Invoice Number Generation**: This is a critical piece of logic. It must be unique *per supplier*. A robust approach is to find the latest invoice for the supplier and increment its number. This entire read-increment-write process must occur within a serializable or repeatable-read database transaction to prevent race conditions if the user has multiple sessions open.
- **Transactional Integrity**: The creation of the invoice and its line items must be atomic. Use a database transaction to ensure that if saving a line item fails, the entire invoice creation is rolled back.

### Testing
- Integration tests for the `POST /invoices` and `GET /invoices/{id}` endpoints are critical.
- Specifically test the invoice number generation logic under simulated concurrent requests to ensure no duplicates are created.
- Test that the `GET` endpoint correctly enforces ownership and does not leak data between suppliers.
- An E2E test should cover the full user journey: filling out the invoice form, clicking save, being redirected, and verifying the data on the read-only view page.
