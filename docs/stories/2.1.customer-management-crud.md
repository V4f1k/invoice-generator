# Story 2.1: Customer Management (CRUD)

## Status
- Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** to create, view, update, and delete my clients in a dedicated "Customers" section,
**so that** I can maintain a central address book and avoid re-typing customer details for every invoice.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A "Customers" page is added to the main navigation.
2. The page displays a list of all saved customers.
3. The user can add a new customer with all required fields (name, address, IČO, DIČ).
4. The user can edit the details of any existing customer.
5. The user can delete a customer.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Create Customer Database Table (AC: #3)**
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Define the `customers` table schema (id, supplier_id, name, address, ico, dic, timestamps).
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Add a foreign key relationship to the `suppliers` table.
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Implement and apply the database migration.
- [x] **Task 2: Implement Customer API Endpoints (AC: #2, #3, #4, #5)**
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create `GET /api/v1/customers` to list all customers for the authenticated supplier.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Create `POST /api/v1/customers` to add a new customer for the authenticated supplier.
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Create `PUT /api/v1/customers/{id}` to update an existing customer.
  - [x] Subtask 2.4: Create `DELETE /api/v1/customers/{id}` to delete a customer.
  - [x] Subtask 2.5: Ensure all endpoints are protected and enforce ownership (a user can only manage their own supplier's customers).
- [x] **Task 3: Create Frontend Customer Management Page (AC: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5)**
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Add a "Customers" link to the main navigation component.
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Create a new page at the `/customers` route.
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Use a ShadCN table component to display the list of customers fetched from the API.
  - [x] Subtask 3.4: Implement "Add", "Edit", and "Delete" buttons/actions for the customer list.
  - [x] Subtask 3.5: Build the Add/Edit customer form inside a modal dialog, triggered by the respective buttons.

## Dev Notes
- **i18n**: This story involves UI changes. Ensure all static text is implemented using the internationalization framework as per Story 4.1.
- Data ownership is critical. All API endpoints must be secure and verify that the requesting user is authorized to perform the action on the requested customer data (i.e., the customer belongs to the user's supplier).
- The frontend should use React Query (or similar) to manage the fetching, caching, and state of the customer list, ensuring the UI updates automatically after a create, update, or delete operation.

### Testing
- Full integration tests are required for all CRUD endpoints for customers. Tests must verify ownership constraints (e.g., user A cannot access user B's customers).
- Frontend component tests should cover the customer list table and the Add/Edit modal form.
- An E2E test should cover the full customer management flow: creating a new customer, seeing it in the list, editing it, and finally deleting it.
